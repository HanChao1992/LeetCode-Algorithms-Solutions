Solutions for LeetCode Algorithms Problems

## 1) Two Sum (Accepted)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

## 2) Add Two Numbers (Accepted)

You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

## 3) Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Time out on the Last Test)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## 4) Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Accepted)

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

## 5) Longest Palindromic Substring (Accepted)

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

## 7) Reverse Integer (Accepted)

Reverse digits of an integer.

## 8) String to Integer (Skipped)

Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

## 9) Palindrome Number (Accepted)

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.

## 10) Regular Expression Matching (In Progress)

Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

## 14) Longest Common Prefix (Accepted)

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

## 19) Remove Nth Node From End of List (Accepted)

Given a linked list, remove the Nth node from the end of list and return its head.

## 20) Valid Parentheses (Accepted)

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.

## 21) Merge Two Sorted Lists (Accepted)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
